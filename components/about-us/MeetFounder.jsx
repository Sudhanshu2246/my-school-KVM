            In 2004, after retiring from his post as a government school teacher, 
            Late Mr. Sampati Ram Ji laid the foundation of this institution with a vision 
            to <span className="font-semibold">educate every child</span> and make quality 
            education <span className="font-semibold">affordable for all sections of society</span>. 
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Known for his <span className="text-blue-600 font-medium">hard work, discipline, and dedication</span>, 
            he spent countless hours guiding students, supporting teachers, and ensuring that the school 
            grew with strong values. Even after his retirement, his passion for education never faded.
